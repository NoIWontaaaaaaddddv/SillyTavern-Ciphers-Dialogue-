# Translation and Ciphers

## Description

This extension allows automatic, client-side translation of dialogue. While
LLMs are good at languages, it's somewhat challenging to make it follow strict language rules. This extension parses messages automatically and translates text using in-built SillyTavern translation APIs. 

The extension uses localStorage for storing character data at this stage.

!! IMPORTANT !!

It's not recommended to use this extension in chats with many untranslated messages (50+)
